# Dynamic Table UI

This project is a React-based UI application that showcases a dynamic table where users can add/remove rows and columns and applied state management on it. The application uses the `randomcolor` library to generate bright and strong colors for the text.

## Features

- **Dynamic Table**: Add or remove rows and columns.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder rows using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Modal for Design Insertion**: Insert designs into specific variant columns using a modal.
- **Scrollable Variants**: If the number of variants exceeds four, a horizontal scroll is enabled while keeping the product filter column fixed.
- **Colorful Text**: Display each word of a given text in a different strong color.
